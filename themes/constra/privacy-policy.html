                    <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
                    <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure,
                      modification, or unauthorised destruction of the Data.<br />The Data processing is carried out
                      using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organisational procedures and modes strictly
                      related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be
                      accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application
                      (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as
                      third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies,
                      communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated
                      list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>
                    <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
                    <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
                        legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such
                        processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal
                        bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to
                        European data protection law;</li>
                      <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for
                        any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                      <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
                      </li>
                      <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise
                        of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
                      <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or
                        by a third party.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                      processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
                      requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>
                    <h3>Place</h3>
                    <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
                      involved in the processing are located.<br /><br />
                      Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a
                      country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
                      Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
                    <p>If broader protection standards are applicable, Users are also entitled to learn about the legal
                      basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international
                      organisation governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the
                      UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br /><br />
                      If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of
                      this document or enquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
                    <h3>Retention time</h3>
                    <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
                      collected for.</p>
                    <p>Therefore:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the
                        Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
                      <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained
                        as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
                        legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by
                        contacting the Owner.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
                      consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may
                      be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the
                      performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br /><br />
                      Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access,
                      the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be
                      enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>

                    <p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>
                    <p>Users entitled to broader protection standards may exercise any of the rights described below. In
                      all other cases, Users may enquire with the Owner to find out which rights apply to them.</p>
                    <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Withdraw their consent at any time.</strong> Users have the right to withdraw consent
                        where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.</li>
                      <li><strong>Object to processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to object to the
                        processing of their Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent.
                        Further details are provided in the dedicated section below.</li>
                      <li><strong>Access their Data.</strong> Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed
                        by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of
                        the Data undergoing processing.</li>
                      <li><strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of
                        their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.</li>
                      <li><strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right, under certain
                        circumstances, to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not
                        process their Data for any purpose other than storing it.
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</strong> Users have the right,
                        under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.</li>
                      <li><strong>Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller.</strong> Users have
                        the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and,
                        if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.
                        This provision is applicable provided that the Data is processed by automated means and that the
                        processing is based on the User's consent, on a contract which the User is part of or on
                        pre-contractual obligations thereof.</li>
                      <li><strong>Lodge a complaint.</strong> Users have the right to bring a claim before their
                        competent data protection authority.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Details about the right to object to processing</h3>
                    <p>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
                      vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users
                      may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to
                      justify the objection.</p>
                    <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing
                      purposes, they can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To
                      learn, whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may
                      refer to the relevant sections of this document. </p>

                    <h3>How to exercise these rights</h3>
                    <p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details
                      provided in this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by
                      the Owner as early as possible and always within one month.</p>

                    <h2>Applicability of broader protection standards</h2>
                    <p>While most provisions of this document concern all Users, some provisions expressly only apply if
                      the processing of Personal Data is subject to broader protection standards.</p>
                    <p>Such broader protection standards apply when the processing:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>is performed by an Owner based within the EU;</li>
                      <li>concerns the Personal Data of Users who are in the EU and is related to the offering of paid
                        or unpaid goods or services, to such Users;</li>
                      <li>concerns the Personal Data of Users who are in the EU and allows the Owner to monitor such
                        Users’ behaviour taking place in the EU.</li>
